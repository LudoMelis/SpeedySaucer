# SpeedySaucer
Speedy Saucer game repository.
This is my first contact with the Godot game engine.
So the focuses of this small project were to familiarize with the editor and create a physics-enabled small game.
You probably don't have any interest with this unless you're learning Godot.

Future update will hopefully include xinput controller support and some little tweaks.
