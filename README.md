# SpeedySaucer
Speedy Saucer game repository.
This is my first contact with the Godot game engine.
So the focuses of this small project were to familiarize with the editor and create a physics-enabled small game.
You probably don't have any interest with this unless you're learning Godot.

A scoring system is computed from player velocity. You can aim for higher scores by being as fast as possible.

xinput controller support has been added and analog input is now supported.
